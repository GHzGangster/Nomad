An open-source rewrite of the Metal Gear Online 2 server for [SaveMGO](https://savemgo.com/).

The server is written in Java, using Netty for NIO server functionality.
The server is designed to call a main web server api, in order to allow for easy changes and internalizing code.

The server requires Java 8. I do not intend to lower the required version.
